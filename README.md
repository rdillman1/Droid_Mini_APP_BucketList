# Project Report
## 01/14/21
reviewed gitlab, created github account
created repository. Played around learning android app dev. 

## 01/19/21
Today was the first meeting to go over the project requriements and what we have so far. We've set up project on GitLab.
reviewed what has been completed thus far. 
found we did not have a lot to go over scheduled to meet again next week
reviewed java classes
and created a solid xml template for the application 
additemActivity
bucketListActivity
add_item_layout

setup intents and recycler view to transfer between the two.

## 01/21/21
hjung informed me that she will no longer be taking the course
I reviewed professors code examples and was able to setup my adaptor. 
I also read about using a model to do the legwork for getcommands. 
setup a model.java and implemented into my adaptor.java
was able to setup test recyclerview panels. 
confirmed all intents open to the right .java and xml.

## 01/31/21
Reviewed milestone requirements
setup edititem.java and intent embeded into the add_item_layout.xml(recyclerview) 
this opened up to a edit_item xml

added a check button to add_item xml
This is meant to take the location Lat and long and present the location city at the bottom. 
Upon researching this capability. This idea may get scraped due to complexity. 

Uploaded zip document to gitlab where the project resides. 
for some reason my gitbash has repository setup on github but not gitlab. Im not entirely sure 
what was done wrong to cause this confusion. 


# Lessons Learned
Learned how to style and xml document
Learned the difference between contraint and relative layout. 
learned about recycler view and how to set it as scrollable. 
learned about intents and how to call new activities. 
learned how to setup a spash screen
learned how to setup an item layout

FINAL PROJECT SUMBMISSION NOTES
##02/01/21
Feeling good so far go my google maps implemented and all I have left Is to choose how to band my data together. 
Everything is flowing good!

##02/13/21
Today has been stressful
I went the route of using a database, and I am in way over my head. I have made the project way to complicated 
and now debugging my code is a nightmare.. worked almost 14 stright hours goshh. haha

## 02/14/20

I have given up on getting all my data to pass through the db I am now just sticking with one for now. 
I have the Bucket item working successfully. 
I have everything else working as expected.



# Lessons Learned
Learned java SQLlite db insertion. 
Learned how to impletment swipe behavior
Learned how to implement and manage dialog bottom sheets, a really clean way to transfer data. 
Learned that having eyes bigger than your skillset is a horrible idea in a project envoinment. 
Learned that even if you feel confident in your project keep on it. 
Learned and successfuly inplemented toast. 
Learned how to utilize db manipulation via db inspector in android studio. 
LEarned that if you dont plan before you start working on potential solutions you will have crazy looking code. (Sorry)
Relearned gitlab and really got to enjoy the importance of organizing your repositiories. 
I learned a lot about myself and how I can improve as a programmer. These past few days have taught me that I dont know anything. 
But I enjoyed the struggle, that shows im on the right track. I really enjoy when things come together, but this time I fell short. 

Expect better things next project.

## How to Use
I used Pixel 4
recommend a device with google play for google maps
The Recycler view is one item, the bucket goal. 
The list is swipeable to delete and edit. Unfortunatly I failed on working with the db. Haveing 4 items to pull from was too much, but I got a lot of good experience!!!

Most of the other things are pretty stright forward
