hjung informed me that she will no longer be taking the course
I reviewed professors code examples and was able to setup my adaptor. 
I also read about using a model to do the legwork for getcommands. 
setup a model.java and implemented into my adaptor.java
was able to setup test recyclerview panels. 
confirmed all intents open to the right .java and xml.
##01/31/21
Reviewed milestone requirements
setup edititem.java and intent embeded into the add_item_layout.xml(recyclerview) 
this opened up to a edit_item xml

added a check button to add_item xml
This is meant to take the location Lat and long and present the location city at the bottom. 
Upon researching this capability. This idea may get scraped due to complexity. 

Uploaded zip document to gitlab where the project resides. 
for some reason my gitbash has repository setup on github but not gitlab. Im not entirely sure 
what was done wrong to cause this confusion.
